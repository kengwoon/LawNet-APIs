## 1 INTRODUCTION <a name="itrd"></a>

This document aims to provide an overview of the Singapore Academy of Law’s (“SAL”) LawNet Legal Research APIs and how you can best use them to create new products and services to enhance your applications with legal data. SAL’s Legal Research APIs provide the ability to:

•	Search Cases in LawNet <br>
•	Get Full Text of Cases in LawNet

To use our Legal Research APIs, an API Key and data entitlement will be created for you by Singapore Academy of Law to access the API end points. Application forms are available and access will be subject to all relevant Terms and Conditions.
Where appropriate, access will only be granted to a sandbox environment which comprises of a subset of the production content. This would enable you to assess the APIs and data to see how they can integrate with your systems.


## 2 LIBRARIES <a name="lbries"></a>

Our Legal Research APIs are built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful and it:

- Uses predictable, resource-oriented URLs.
- Uses built-in HTTP capabilities for passing parameters and authentication.
- Responds with standard HTTP response codes to indicate errors.
- Returns XML.

You may use your favorite or any suggested HTTP/REST library available for your programming language, to make
HTTP calls to our Legal Research APIs.

Below are some common language-specific notes which you may use.

>### 2.1 cURL
>[cURL](http://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) is a popular command line tool to make HTTP requests with. It is a very simple but quite powerful tool. With it, you can send data using any HTTP method. You can send post data and query parameters and files in a very consistent and elegant way.

>### 2.2 C#
>For C# developers, you may use [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/).

>### 2.3 JAVA
>Check out the [UniRest](http://unirest.io/java.html) REST client if Java is your weapon of choice. You will also need the following dependencies, eg. org.json, httpclient 4.3.6, httpmime 4.3.6, httpasyncclient 4.0.2

>### 2.4 POSTMAN
>[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a Chrome add-on and Mac application which is used to fire requests to an API. It is very lightweight and fast. Requests can be organised in groups, and tests can also be created with verifications for certain
conditions on the response. It is possible to make different kinds of HTTP requests – GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and
DELETE. It is also possible to add headers to the requests. 

## 3 API REFERENCE <a name="apiref"></a>

### 3.1 INTRODUCTION

This section provides you with information about the Legal Research APIs and sample scripts (refer to section 3.2)
that will function. You are welcome to copy/paste and run the scripts to see the APIs in action.

#### 3.1.1	Base URL
All Legal Research API URLs referenced in this documentation start with the following base part:

Trial:
```https://test-legalresearch.api.sal.sg```

#### 3.1.2 Authentication

When you sign up for an account and approval is granted, you will be given a set of Access Credentials including
an APIkey. The APIkey will determine the content available to your account.

Authentication with the Legal Research APIs is done by inserting the APIkey as a parameter and as part of header
in the request.

Authentication with the API gateway occurs when searching for cases and retrieving content.

_```Important: Keep your API key secret!```_

#### 3.1.3 Data Access Level (Entitlement)

In addition to the APIkey, an excel sheet containing a list of content access codes will also be provided to you for
accessing of data. The access codes for the content is required as a parameter when using services in sections
3.2.1 and 3.2.2.

<img src="/Technical Documentation/Data Access Level (Entitlement).png" alt="Data Access Level"/>

#### 3.1.4 Response Codes

The following standard HTTP response codes.

| Code |Description|
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|200| Success - search results or full text of content returned.|
|400| Bad Request - Often this is because a required parameter is missing or a parameter’s value is invalid. Note: this is returned in XML format.|
|402| Request Failed - Parameters valid but request failed|
|403| Forbidden – Invalid/Missing API Key|
|404| Not Found - The requested item doesn’t exist|
|500, 502, 503, 504| Server Errors - something is wrong on our end|

The table below provides you with various scenarios and the expected responses, based on an entitlement below.

|Scenario|Description|Response Code|Category Code|Level 2 Category Code|Level 3 Category Code|Expected Response (xml)|
|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------------------------------------------------|

## 4 FAQ <a name="qn"></a>

<br>

Q: Why I am receiving response “forbidden”?
<br>
A: This is because the API key used is invalid or empty or not found in header under key x-api-key. <br>
{ "message": "Forbidden"}.

<br>

Q: I’m not able to convert binary PDF and image to physical file. How can I do it?
<br>
A: You need to convert the binary String to Byte Array and simply write the bytes onto your local machine
programmatically.
<br>
Sample code in C#:
```
byte[] bytes;
bytes = StringToByteArray(binaryString);
System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(@"C:\Projects\hello.pdf", bytes);
```
<br>

Q: What is the API request limit set to my account?
<br>
A: Each account is entitled to 100,000 per month API requests. . 

<br>

Q: How do I report an issue encountered?
<br>
A: Please provide the details on

1. API endpoint
1. Headers
1. API request
1. response/error
