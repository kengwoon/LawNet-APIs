# LawNet APIs
<br>

### LawNet Legal Research APIs allow you to:

- Search Singapore cases in LawNet <br>
- Get full text of Singapore cases in LawNet
<br>

### Who is offering this?

LawNet APIs is offered by the Singapore Academy of Law, which runs [LawNet](https://www.lawnet.sg/lawnet/web/lawnet/home), a website that provides a Legal Research service to over 80% of Singapore’s legal profession. LawNet subscribers can search different types of legal content from multiple sources in one go. The APIs are intended to be used to create new products and services that can serve the legal industry as well as assist members of public with their legal needs. It is our hope that this will encourage innovation and creativity within the Legal Industry in Singapore.
